      <p class="card-text">Graduated in 1996 from Mohammedia School of Engineers in Rabat,
         as Hydrogeologist and Geologist Engineer.</p>
       
       <p>I begun my career as a former staff in University Hassan First in Settat,
        where I occupy during some years the position of responsible public procurement,
      Then moved to the Polydiscplinary Faculty of Khouribga</p>
      
      <p>I have for two semester teached real analysis for the students in Physics-Chemistry and Economics Science and management,
      I have also teached soil mechanics for the students of Geological and mining georesources<p>
      
        <p>I spent some years on Quora forum where I interacted with a wide community of mathematicians,
      my passion was to solve math problems posted by people on Quora website<p>
      <p>I have also made some bibliographic studies in the exiting field of Markov decision Processes,
      and I have submitted an accepted paper entitled: 
      "A Novel method For accelerating the Value Iteration Algorithm Of A Discounted 
      Discrete Markov Decision Prcesses" to MOCASIM 2017.</p> 
      <p>After that, I was attracted by DevOps, and I am actually working on the ENME stack
      (Express Node MongoDB,EJS).<br>
        This dynamic website is created, following the book of Lim Greg, but not entirely.
        Vscode copilot, was also a Great compagnon during this real challenge! especially 
        during deployement stage. 
        but I also benefited from the well structured answers provided by Deepseek especially when buying domain name  and during its configuration
